# Components

## Definition

Components use the following definition:

```javascript
{
    // Unique identifier of component.
    "name": "component-identifier",
    // Name shown in UI for component. See LOCALIZATION.md for information on how to localize.
    "label": "Component",
    // Path to icon image. Can be anything that is displayable by the browser.
    // It's recommended to use either SVG, PNG or JPG.
    // The icons should be roughly square in size (for example 128 by 128 pixels).
    "icon": "path-in-set",

    // List of properties available for this component.
    // Refers to the identifiers in the componentProperties section.
    "properties":[
        ...
    ],

    // How this component is selectable.
    // By "default" the user can click inside the component to select it.
    // The "handle" option adds a draggable bar with the component name at the right top of the component.
    // This option is useful for components that have non clickable content (such as iframes).
    "selectionMethod": "default" | "handle",

    // Whether or not the textual content of components should be included in the article statistics (total number of
    // characters, words, paragraphs).
    // Default = false.
    "countStatistics": true | false,

    // Allows nesting the component in containers.
    // Defaults = yes.
    "allowNesting": "yes" | "no" | "one-level",

    // Restricts children of this component to the listed ones.
    // The "withContent" key can be used to filter down on the content of a directive. 
    // For example this can be used to require that a doc-image directive has an image 
    // applied by the user.
    "restrictChildren": {
        "image-comp": { "withContent": "image" }
    },

    // Optional property which overrides the global "defaultComponentOnEnter" property.
    // For example it can be used to define a special container component where the default component which
    // is created when pressing Enter will differ from the default component that is added when pressing
    // Enter outside the container.
    // Introduced in version 1.1.0
    "defaultComponentOnEnter": "componentName"

    // Optional property to configure options per directive in the component
    "directiveOptions": {
        "directiveKey": {
            // Optional property which defines directives autofill rules.
            // It can be used when the content of a component should be filled automatically.
            // For example the editable directive can be filled from the image directive when an image is added to an article,
            // using one of metadata properties of the Enterprise image object (it currently works with Enterprise metadata only)
            // There is also an ability to set different trigger options. "Once" means that it will be triggered on first
            // data setting, in case of image directive - when image is added for the first time
            // Introduced in version 1.1.0
            "autofill": {
                "source": "sourceDirectiveKey",
                "metadataField": "ContentMetaData/Description", // Enterprise metadata format, case sensitive
                "trigger": "always"     // "once" | "always", by default it is "always"
            },

            // Optional property to configure groups for container directives
            // This allows overriding the components displayed in the Component window inside a container.
            // For example, you could design a list type component that only displays a list item component
            // inside the container.
            // Introduced in version 1.1.0
            "groups": [
                {
                    // Group definition, see GROUPS.md
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

The component definitions are complemented by templates used for rendering.

## HTML template

HTML templates are used for rendering the editor content, but also for HTML output to publish channels. It's possible to add anything to the HTML template, however, interactivity with the editor is provided through a fixed set of directives that can be set on HTML elements as attributes. The syntax of such a directive is:

```html
<TAG doc-<directive-name>=<content-key>>
```

For example, the default body component applies the doc-editable directive to make the contents of the element editable:

```html
<p class="text body" doc-editable="text">
  Body Placeholder Text
</p>
```

The content-key is used as key in the digital article format. It's also used in the conversion rules to automatically map text fields from one to another.

The full table of available directives is:

| Directive | Behavior |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [doc-editable](directives/EDITABLE.md) | Binds editable text to an element |
| [doc-image](directives/IMAGE.md) | Binds image to an element |
| doc-container | Turns the element into a container, allowing component nesting |
| doc-html | Replaces content of element with the raw HTML, allowing to embed content |
| [doc-slideshow](directives/SLIDESHOW.md) | Adds slideshow functionality to element |
| doc-link | Turns the element into a link. A property must be added to the component to configure the url |
| doc-media | Allows rendering social media in the element |
| doc-interactive | Directive for interactive component feature |

### Styling

Each component should also contain one [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/guide) file as styling. Each file should contain one CSS class for one class named after the component. This class should be added to the root html element in the template.

For example, the body component styling may look like:

```css
/* Body component style */
.body {
    font-weight: 400;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-style: normal;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #606060;
    margin: 12px auto;
}
```

## PSV Template

Custom channels support the option to receive the rendered article in [PSV format](http://www.prismstandard.org/specifications/psv/1.0/PSV_specification_1.0.htm). When using this option, you must define a template for each component to have a PSV rendition.
The component is skipped in the PSV output when it has no matching template.

## Facebook Instant Articles template

Publishing to Facebook Instant Articles requires an HTML markup template for each component you wish to support.
You should use the same directives to bind content to the template as used in the HTML template.
The component is skipped in the Facebook output when it has no matching template.
For more information please visit the [Facebook Instant Articles documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/guides/format-overview).
